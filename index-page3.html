                                    while maintaining anonymity. KYC and AML checks: why do you need identity
                                    verification in the crypto-currency field.
                                    KYC (Know Your Customer) is a procedure for verifying the identity of a client and
                                    assessing potential risks from him.
                                    But why is it needed and why is it almost impossible to buy cryptocurrency today
                                    without verifying your identity?
                                    Does this not contradict the original principles of anonymity and decentralization
                                    of the crypto industry?
                                    Today we will analyze what AML and KYC checks are for and how they work. We will
                                    also tell you how verification will help
                                    reduce the number of fraudsters while maintaining basic user anonymity</p>

                                <p>What is AML and what is it for?</p>

                                    Anti-Money Laundering is a set of measures to counter money laundering, terrorist
                                    financing and the creation of weapons
                                    of mass destruction. This procedure includes the identification, storage and mutual
                                    exchange of information about customers,
                                    their profits and transactions between financial institutions and government
                                    departments. Most classical financial institutions
                                    use AML measures to check a business that works with cash or uses cash as one of the
                                    main assets. They also check those
                                    enterprises that have money in different accounts, regularly transfer them to other
                                    countries and banks, buy futures and
                                    other instruments for cash settlement. In other words, all businesses that can
                                    potentially bypass financial monitoring and
                                    launder funds fall under verification</p>

                                <p>
                                    If the service does not conduct such checks, then fraudsters can use it as a
                                    platform for money laundering and terrorist financing.
                                    And then the service itself will be held accountable. That is why exchanges and
                                    other large cryptocurrency companies
                                    implement AML requirements in their business and conduct regular KYC verifications
                                </p>
